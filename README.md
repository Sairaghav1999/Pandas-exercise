# Pandas-exercise

Just plan on practicing different exercises on pandas every week to brush up my skills and keep it in check. Even though it seems very minimal pandas is the epicenter of all data science tasks. Just plan on doing it regularly as it takes very minimal time of the day and who am I kidding its fun. 

I am solving the exercised given in this github repo https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises . Did go through them and honestly felt like there's alot I do not know about pandas. Will keep updating it as I solve them accordingly. 

PS: I refer to the solutions if I give up xP but hey I try not to repeat it again

## Exercise-2
- This was actually not to straight forward as I've thought somehow struggled with the value_counts operation and the average part. Played around with the lambda function.
